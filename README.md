# The_Breakfast_Club

A Project for my Codecademy course.
The goal is to make a fully responsive website based upon a real or fake club.

## About The Breakfast Club

The Breakfast Club is a made up club.
The idea is that the club is to help people eat the most important meal of the day breakfast!
As someone who struggles to eat in the morning I often find myself looking for yummy breakfast recipes that don't take alot of time to make.

So the point is to help people in the same situation as me.
The website itself is currently just for looks and for a responsive design as part of my journey becoming a full-stack developer.

Although this is a fake club it is possible that I make this a real thing, It's entirely up to the comments and feedback I get.

#### The potential of the website is there and I'll do alot more work if people are intrested...

i.e I'll create a discord group and I'll create an Instagram aswell to bring the club together.
