# The_Breakfast_Club

This is the responsive club project by Codecademy.
Here I need to make a site fully responsive it also0 needs to be based on a real or fake club,
I have chosen to do The Breakfast Club, its a made up club that I thought of, Its just a site to promote the club and find new members depending on comments I might make the club a real thing.

## Do you struggle to eat breakfast?

Well the aim of this club is to give people insperation to eat breakfast. 
It won't have any of said instagram or discord unless people actually want me to make them.
